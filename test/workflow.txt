# Finding Scale where aQGC Couplings become important
#
Have written a script to automatically generate madgraph events for
the LNuAA signal.
In Scripts Directory:
./LNuAAsub.sh
If coupling is significant, the output is stored in:
RootFiles/LNuAA_aQGC_Histograms

#
# Reweighting
#
step0_None.py and testReader_cfg.py are both capable of taking a reweighted 
lhe file and converting it into an EDM formatted root file.
reweighted_events_test_Step0.root and reweighted_events_test.root respectively.

reweight_edmtoroottree_cfg.py is the config file for running the lnuaa_analyzer
which take the EDM format root file, and stores the information in a simple 
tree.
